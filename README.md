This repo presents the project ”Question Generation from Fable Stories in Hindi ”
undertaken by our team consisting of Gargi Shroff, Ketaki Shetye and myself. The project aims to generate questions from fable stories using
dependency grammar and text analysis techniques. It follows a multi-phase approach involving data
preprocessing, text analysis, and question formation. The results obtained are also
provided, along with additional resources for further exploration.
